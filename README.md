# Lem(m)a

Lemma is a scalable, single-page JavaScript application for natural-language processing built in the Angular framework. It measures cosine similarity between the tf-idf vectors of a query and a control set of data. Because it incorporates Browserify, it can use all the algorithms of the "Natural" node module.

## Background

Lem(m)a is my first step in testing a theory I have about the use of digital tools to quantify qualitative human phenomena. After reading Bren&#233; Brown's [_Daring Greatly_](https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1484430978&sr=1-1&keywords=daring+greatly), I decided to test the limits of my ability to evaluate abstract ideas. Early in that book, Brown writes, "I was riveted by a statement from one of my research professors, 'If you can't measure it, it doesn't exist.'" I wanted to know how far I could take that idea. So I began with a topic for which I have expertise: religious struggle. Thus Lem(m)a. It is the ancient Greek word for "theory" or "proposition," the koine Greek transliteration of the biblical Hebrew word for "why," and the technical term for the dictionary entry of a word. I have a theory about the use of ancient Israelite psalms of lament to quantify religious struggle. Lem(m)a parses the data for me and presents it in an intelligible form with the help of [D3](https://d3js.org/).
