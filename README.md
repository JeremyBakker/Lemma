# Lemma

Lemma is a scalable, single-page JavaScript application for natural-language processing built in the Angular framework. It measures cosine similarity between the tf-idf vectors of a query and a control set of data. Because it incorporates Browserify, it can use all the algorithms of the "Natural" node module. Nonetheless, I coded Lemma's tf-idf algorithm myself because I wanted to know more about its strengths and weaknesses. Lemma is my first step in testing a theory I have about the use of digital tools to quantify qualitative human phenomena.
